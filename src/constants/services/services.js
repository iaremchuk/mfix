        description: "Suspended Ceilings can be installed to the majority of all applications to create personalised ceilings and meet technical requirements such as acoustics, moisture, hygiene and fire. This system can utilise many different styles, colours and textures of tiles. Where access to the ceiling void is required. Where an acoustic absorption performance is required. Where hygiene is a key criteria. Where no decorating is possible. The tiles are placed in a galvanised steel grid system hung from the structural soffit by either wire or angle sections.",

        title: "Steel Framing Systems",
        description: "SFS is a component-supply, structural, stud façade system which is extremely versatile and can be used to provide solutions to many different types of building construction, from external wall infill panels to internal high bay separating walls and continuous superstructure solutions. The system consists of C and U shaped studs and tracks, designed on a project-specific basis and constructed on site. This lightweight, galvanised and cold rolled system has many benefits over more traditional walling systems including speed of construction and cost effectiveness. Legend Construction have a proven track record in the design and installation of Steel Framing Systems (SFS), facilitating fast track programmes and architectural demands with experienced installers.",

        title: "Standard Partitions",
        description: "Standard Partitions may be specified with confidence for non-load bearing partitions and use fast drywall construction techniques (for both commercial and domestic partitions, versatile systems to meet nearly every performance requirement, minimum amount of components). These systems can utilise the entire range of boards, including wallboard, moisture board, sound shield, fire shield,and dense shield, depending on the performance required. The boards are fixed onto a lightweight metal stud. C stud partitions provide the simplest and most economical system, whilst I stud partitions should be used when a more rigid partition is required, without increasing the overall thickness.",

        title: "Taping and Jointing",
        description: "The tape and jointing system is used for the seamless jointing of tapered edge boards to walls and ceilings. Jointing of all flat, internal and external corner joints is achieved with the application of two coats of joint filler and one coat of joint cement to leave a smooth finish ready for decoration. This means for faster setting and drying times, obviously permitting quicker decoration. Only a small amount of material is required on site compared to wet plaster.",
